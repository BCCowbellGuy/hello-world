Hello there!

This is BCCowbellGuy, and I'm an aspiring programmer.  Someday, I hope to work on video games that many people enjoy as a full-time career.  I'm sure it's a tough field to get into, and I'd be giving up a lot to go for it, but it's something I'm very interested in and look forward to trying!

Nice to meet you all!
BCCowbellGuy
